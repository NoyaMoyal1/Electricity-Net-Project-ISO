# Electricity-Net-Project-ISO
This repository contains an experimental framework for ISO-side electricity pricing and dispatch using reinforcement learning. It includes both model-free (TD3, PPO, Recurrent PPO) and model-based (PETS) pipelines, a configurable ISO/PCS simulation environment, training/evaluation scripts, and reproducible experiment setups (local and Slurm).
